# Speakids Project
This repository contains a college project called Speakids, an app that aims to assist children in learning the English language. The purpose of the application is only to provide a prototype of what an educational application for children would look like, with some multimedia features such as audio, video, background music and illustrative images. This project is part of the evaluation of two disciplines of the Computer Science course at UNINASSAU: Integrator Topic and Multimedia Systems.
